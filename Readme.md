#REST API


I am creating the Rest Api using nodejs.
we need to install the required libraries.
Node
Express
Joi
Nodemon


Express is a web framework which can be used with nodejs.  Express help us to create restful api with the help of helper method, middle layers to configure our application.

JOI allows us to validate the correctness of the format.

Nodemon helps to configure the changes in the code and make the update according to that in the server and shows the error and conflicts and it makes the server live and because of that we don't need to run the server all the time whenever we have made a change in the code.
Nodemon keep a watch on all the files with any type of extension present on the project folder.


Then according to the json file we have created the index.js that has been initiated during the node initialization. 

In the index.js file we are importing all the libraries and framework.
